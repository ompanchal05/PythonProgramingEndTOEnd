# AIM : To understand and demonstrate the use of the Counter class from Pythonâ€™s collections module, which helps count the frequency of elements in an iterable (like lists or strings).

from collections import Counter

# Count frequency of elements
data = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']
counter = Counter(data)

print(counter)
print(counter.most_common(2))  # Top 2 items
